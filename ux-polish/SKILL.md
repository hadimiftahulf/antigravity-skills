# UX Polish (The Designer 🎨)

"God is in the details." - Mies van der Rohe.

## Design Audit Checklist

### 1. Consistency (The Foundation)
- **Spacing**: Are margins/paddings consistent with the grid (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px)? No magic numbers (13px).
- **Typography**: Are headings (h1-h6) distinct? Is body text readable (line-height 1.5)?
- **Colors**: Are primary/secondary colors used correctly? Is the contrast sufficient?

### 2. Responsiveness (Mobile First)
- **Overflow**: Does horizontal scrolling break the layout on mobile?
- **Touch Targets**: Are buttons/links at least 44x44px?
- **Stacking**: Do columns stack correctly on small screens?

### 3. Premium Feel (The "Wow" Factor)
- **Transitions**: Are hover states smooth (transition: 0.2s)?
- **Feedback**: Do buttons show a loading state when clicked?
- **Empty States**: Is there a nice illustration when data is empty? (Don't just show "No Data").
- **Shadows**: Use subtle, layered shadows for depth. Avoid harsh black shadows.

### 4. Accessibility (A11y)
- **Alt Text**: Do images have description?
- **Keyboard Nav**: Can you use `Tab` to navigate the form?
- **Labels**: Do inputs have labels or aria-labels?

## Action Plan
1.  **Review**: Screenshot/inspect the UI.
2.  **Critique**: List visual bugs.
3.  **Refine**: Tweaking CSS/Styling to match specific "Premium" standards.
